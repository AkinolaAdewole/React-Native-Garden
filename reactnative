React Native is a popular open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to write mobile apps for both iOS and Android using a single codebase. React Native uses the same fundamental building blocks as traditional mobile apps but with React components, enabling the development of rich, native-like user interfaces.

Key Features of React Native:
Cross-Platform Development:

Write once, run on both iOS and Android. React Native allows you to use the same codebase for multiple platforms, saving time and effort compared to building separate apps for each platform.
Native Performance:

React Native renders components using native views, providing a near-native performance for mobile apps. It bridges JavaScript code with native APIs, making apps faster and more responsive than traditional hybrid apps.
React-based:

React Native is based on React, so developers can use familiar concepts like components, JSX (JavaScript XML), state, and props. This makes it easier for React web developers to transition into mobile development.
Hot Reloading:

React Native has a hot reloading feature, which allows developers to see changes in real-time without having to recompile the app. This speeds up the development process and allows faster iteration.
Reusable Components:

React Native components are reusable across different platforms. You can use pre-built native components or create your own, ensuring consistent UI and functionality across iOS and Android.
Access to Native APIs:

React Native provides access to native device features like the camera, GPS, accelerometer, and more, using native modules. You can also write custom native code when necessary to extend the app's functionality.
Large Ecosystem and Community:

React Native has a large and active developer community, which means a vast number of third-party libraries, tools, and resources are available. This makes it easier to solve problems and add features to your app.
Flexibility:

React Native allows you to combine JavaScript and native code. If needed, you can write native modules in Swift (for iOS) or Java/Kotlin (for Android) and integrate them into your app alongside React Native.
