React Native is a popular open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to write mobile apps for both iOS and Android using a single codebase. React Native uses the same fundamental building blocks as traditional mobile apps but with React components, enabling the development of rich, native-like user interfaces.
