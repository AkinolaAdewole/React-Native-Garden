Expo:
Expo is a set of tools and services built on top of React Native that simplifies the development process by abstracting much of the native configuration. It allows you to build React Native apps without directly dealing with Xcode or Android Studio during most of the development process.
Ease of Use: High. Comes with a pre-configured environment and many useful features out of the box, like push notifications, camera, GPS, etc.
Limitations: Certain native features or custom native code might not be possible without ejecting (detaching) from the managed workflow.
Complexity: Low. It's much simpler to set up and get started, especially for beginners.


When to Choose React Native vs Expo

Choose Expo if:
You are new to React Native and want a quick start without worrying about native configurations.
You want to avoid managing native code and focus purely on JavaScript/React development.
You’re building an MVP or simple app that doesn’t need deep native customizations.
You want fast iteration, easy app testing, and over-the-air updates.
You prefer a streamlined, managed environment with fewer setup and configuration tasks.
You want to use Expo Go to quickly test your app on physical devices without a complicated setup.


For a complex game like Designer City 2, which requires high performance, real-time updates, complex animations, and possibly 3D graphics, React Native is the better choice because it provides:

Full access to native code and performance optimizations.
Flexibility to integrate third-party game engines (Unity, Cocos2d).
Direct control over rendering, memory management, and game mechanics.
Expo, while excellent for rapid mobile app development, is not well-suited for performance-heavy games. If you start with Expo and eventually need more performance or access to native features, you would have to eject to React Native, losing many of Expo’s advantages.

So, if you're aiming to build a game like Designer City 2, you should start with React Native to avoid limitations down the road. You can integrate game engines and custom native code, providing the performance and flexibility needed for game development.
