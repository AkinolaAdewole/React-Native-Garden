When to Choose React Native vs Expo

Choose Expo if:
You are new to React Native and want a quick start without worrying about native configurations.
You want to avoid managing native code and focus purely on JavaScript/React development.
You’re building an MVP or simple app that doesn’t need deep native customizations.
You want fast iteration, easy app testing, and over-the-air updates.
You prefer a streamlined, managed environment with fewer setup and configuration tasks.
You want to use Expo Go to quickly test your app on physical devices without a complicated setup.
