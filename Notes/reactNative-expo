Expo is a framework and platform for building React Native applications. It simplifies the development process by providing a set of tools, libraries, and services that make it easier to build, test, and deploy React Native apps. 

Key Features of Expo
Managed Workflow: Expo provides a managed environment where you donâ€™t need to configure native code (Android/iOS). It comes with pre-built libraries.
Pre-installed APIs: It includes APIs for camera, location, push notifications, etc., without requiring manual linking.
Expo Go App: Test your app instantly on a real device without needing a full build process.
Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates: Deploy updates to users without resubmitting to app stores.
Easier Deployment: Publish apps with expo publish and build APKs/IPAs using eas build.


Expo is a great choice for beginners and rapid prototyping. If you need full control over native code, you may want to use the bare React Native workflow.
