. Enable USB Debugging on Android Device
If you're using a physical Android device:
Connect your Android device via USB.
On your Android phone, enable USB Debugging in Developer Options (similar to the steps in my previous message).
Make sure to allow the computer to connect to your device when prompted on your phone.
